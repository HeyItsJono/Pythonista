Pythonista
==========

Various scripts crafted in Pythonista.

When provided, the UIpack file for certain scripts will allow you to easily install both the .py and it's accompanying .pyui file without having to download either of the two individual files. These were packaged using PackUI by dgelessus, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dgelessus/pythonista-scripts/blob/master/UI/PackUI.py). 

| **Name** | **Description** |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Pymgur** | A script which, when run, will take the image on the clipboard, upload it to Imgur, then copy a direct link to the image to the clipboard automatically. This makes sharing images over any messaging service easy. Use the Pythonista Homescreen Shortcut Maker ( http://omz-software.com/pythonista/shortcut/ ) to make this a one click process. |
| **Log Calculator** | UIPack install file for Log Calculator. I wanted an iOS calculator that would let you define base for log calculations so I made this one. |
| **File2Txt** | Converts any file to a .txt file in Pythonista. |
| **Script Downloader** | Allows you to download files within Pythonista by providing a direct url link to the file. Will automatically detect name and extension of the file through use of the clipboard button. Made for downloading scripts from Raw links on Github but can be used for pretty much any filetype from any site. |
